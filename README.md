## Yuliya Nedyalkova

Highly motivated and determined Junior Developer-to-be. Problem solver with positive attitude and attention to detail.  I am seeking a role where I can extend my programming skills and work in a dynamic environment, oriented towards innovation and development.

I believe my strong background in linguistic studies and experience in translation supports a natural and fascinating transition to a programming career. These communication capabilities can help with understanding and expressing customer requirements, and then translating them into working software, using the programming skills gained from the Makers Academy course.

I have a constant enthusiastic curiosity about technology, in particular AI, augmented and mixed reality, and the ethical conflicts that arise between technology and humans. I am thrilled at the prospect of working in software development and having the opportunity to deliver carefully crafted projects.

## Skills

#### Public relations and delivering presentation

During my fourteen-years stay in Italy, I trained corporate staff to use English successfully at work by giving the key communication skills needed to do business in English, in a private language school, and was a connecting point between the technical department and final customers, in an engineering company.

#### Perseverance and scrutiny

My natural inclination is to follow up on a problem and look at it from different perspectives and to anticipate possible outcomes. 

#### Creatively driven and logically minded.

Colleagues can always rely on my ability to listen and analyze a problem and find a logical solution, combined with optimisation of time and efforts.

#### Polyglot

I fluently speak Russian, Italian, Bulgarian and English, and have nearly twenty years of experience in translation.

#### Curious and enthusiastic

I welcome every possibility to discover new facts and news and look at the world with eyes wide open. Enthusiastic about what humanity can achieve with its constant development.

#### Quick study

I consider new subjects a good opportunity to extend my knowledge and subsequently to offer a wider range of skills at my workplace. During my last job at Google I had the chance to take part in frequent trainings and updates.
