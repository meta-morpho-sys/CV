After several years of working in four different countries and various sectors,  I developed curiosity for programming as a consequence of my research in automating of work processes. My first approach to coding were small projects in Python. Being a creative person, it felt natural to experiment with the language and soon after that I decided to make a career change and become a developer.

In July 2017 I took a course at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com) to become a junior full stack web developer. During the course I learned best practices in software development, such as XP values, TDD, version control. I mastered new technologies while taking part in a wide gamut of projects (e.g. see [Pacmean](https://github.com/meta-morpho-sys/pacmean)). Each project was developed by a team with randomly selected members.

I fluently speak four languages and have a constant enthusiastic curiosity about technology, in particular AI, AR, and the ethical conflicts that arise between technology and humans. I am thrilled at the prospect of working in software development and delivering carefully crafted and tested projects.

## *Skills*


| *Skill* | *Description*|
| --- | --- |
|*Programming language agnostic* | With experience in Ruby, Javascript, Python, HTML5, CSS, SQL |
| *Git and GitHub* | Daily experience over the last year with the git command line and GitHub UI, creating around forty repositories, resolving merge conflicts, managing branches, raising pull requests and coordinating work with a large remote team. |
| *Polyglot*| Fluency in Russian, Italian, Bulgarian and English, and have nearly twenty years of experience in translation.|
| *Perseverance and scrutiny* |My natural inclination is to follow up on problems, look at them from different perspectives, and to anticipate possible outcomes.|
| *Creatively driven and logically minded*| Colleagues can always rely on my ability to listen and analyse a problem and find a logical solution, combined with optimisation of time and efforts.|
|*Quick study and keen learner* | I have an appetite for constant learning: during my last job at Google I attended regular training sessions, and while preparing for the Makers Academy course I learned to use MAC OS X, the command line, and three IDEs in under three weeks.|
|*Public relations and delivering presentation* | In my fourteen-years stay in Italy, I trained corporate staff to use English successfully at work by giving the key communication skills needed to do business in English, in a private language school, and was a connecting point between the technical department and final customers, in an engineering company.|
